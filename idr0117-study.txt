Study Title	ske-T, a T-box gene expressed in the skeletogenic mesenchyme lineage of the sea urchin embryo																
Study Type	in-situ hybridization assay																																
Study Type Term Source REF	EFO																																
Study Type Term Accession	OBI_0001686																																
Study Description	T-box transcription factors regulate many developmental processes. Here we report the cloning and expression analysis of ske-T, a novel sea urchin T-box gene. The distribution of the maternal ske-T transcript is uniform in the egg and early embryonic stages while zygotic expression is restricted to the skeletogenic mesenchyme lineage.
